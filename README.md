# UCLA Math 273B Final Presentation

This github repository contains the codes for the final presentation about the paper *"Algorithm for Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality For Time-Dependent Non-convex Hamilton–Jacobi Equations Arising From Optimal Control and Differential Games Problems"* by Yat Tin Chow, Jérôme Darbon, Stanley Osher, Wotao Yin.

The presentation slides can be found from **Math_273B___Presentation.pdf**.

The repository contains three folders:

  - **Bumsu**: This folder contains **C++** code written by Bumsu Kim for the coordinate gradient descent algorithms with parallelization from openmp library. Please email to **bumsu [at] math [dot] ucla [dot] edu** to ask question about the codes.
  
  - **Wonjun**: It contains Python code and C++ code for the coordinate gradient descent algorithms with first few examples from the paper. Please email to **wlee [at] math [dot] ucla [dot] edu** to ask questions about the codes.
    (Note: The python codes works but it is really slow. Please send me an email if you know how to make it faster!)
    
  - **Visualizations**: It contains some videos from the codes.



### Note - March 15, 2019
Bumsu and I are still updating the codes so the codes are not completely done yet.
