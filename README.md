# UCLA Math 273B Final Presentation

This github repository contains the codes for the final presentation about the paper *"Algorithm for Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality For Time-Dependent Non-convex Hamilton–Jacobi Equations Arising From Optimal Control and Differential Games Problems"* by Yat Tin Chow, Jérôme Darbon, Stanley Osher, Wotao Yin.

The repository contains two folders:

  - **Bumsu**: This folder contains **C++** code written by Bumsu Kim for the coordinate gradient descent algorithms with parallelization from openmp library. Please email to **bumsu [at] math [dot] ucla [dot] edu** to ask question about the codes.
  
  - **Wonjun**: Contains Python code and C++ code for the coordinate gradient descent algorithms with first few examples from the paper. Please email to **wlee [at] math [dot] ucla [dot] edu** to ask questions about the codes.
    (Note: The python codes works but it is really slow. Please send me an email if you know how to make it faster!)
